				<p>In March, Gogebic Community College and Northern Michigan University also announced a partnership that will enable nurses with two-year associate’s degrees to get a four-year degree through NMU while attending the GCC campuses in Ironwood or Houghton.

          Based on its curriculum and the affinity with the medical lab science and pre-med programs, nursing will be placed under the Department of Biological Sciences. The program will be based in the Dow building, that will include office space for the faculty that are coming over and two lab spaces that have been prepared for it.
          
          Most of the space in the H-STEM building underway on campus was specifically designed for other purposes. But programs moving into that building next year will free up additional space in existing buildings, Storer said.

				<p>HOUGHTON — Finlandia University’s nursing program will continue at a new home.

          Michigan Technological University’s Board of Trustees formally approved the creation of an undergraduate bachelor of science program in nursing at its meeting Friday. “We’re pleased to be able to bring this nursing program back to our university, especially during this time of exceptional need in the state and in the country for health care professionals such as our nurses,” President Rick Koubek said at Wednesday’s meeting. “Pairing a science-focused degree with industry needs, that’s what Michigan Tech does best, and we’re pleased to support our local health care community by providing a graduating class of skilled nurses.”</p>

          <p>For the last six years, Jeannette Crowe has called the Hughes Health and Rehabilitation Center home. The 84-year-old with multiple sclerosis expected to die at the five-star facility, surrounded by the staff that has become like family. 

            But all that changed last month, when Sam Flaxman — the grandson of the man who bought the West Hartford building in 1961 and turned it into a 170-bed long-term care home — walked into a meeting with the 81 residents still living at Hughes to make a stunning announcement: The nursing home was closing.
